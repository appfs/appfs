Regarding ex3:
I didn't find a shorter solution than ex3.cpp working in C++, but as I didn't use any C++ specific code, I tried compiling with a standard c compiler (gcc) and found a few more tricks.
Code could be further shortened with different compiler/linker options (rename the entrypoint from "main" to "a" for example), but I wanted it to compile without having to use compiler/linker options.
