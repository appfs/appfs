ex10 final submit

inlcudes:
- ex10.cpp
- makefile

boost needs to be installed on local server and path needs to be modified in makefile

to compile call: make
-> g++ -I /usr/local/boost_dir ex10.cpp -o ex10 -std=c++11 -fopenmp -march=native

Program is called
./ex10 'path_to_gph_file' 'n_source_nodes' (-s)

-> example:
./ex10 ./exampleGraphs/big8.gph 100
calls ex10 on big8.gph with openMP-maximal threads for your machine and searches on 100 random source nodes (n_i \in [1,graph.size()]

to run testrun:
make THREADS=X FILE=Y test
-> calls:
OMP_NUM_THREADS=$(X) ./ex10 $../../SP/$(Y) $(N_NODES)
calls ex10 on File Y with #X threads
