Extend exercise 9 such that it can be run in parallel (shared memory, e.\+g. Open\+M\+P for C/\+C++). Furthermore, extend your program such that it tries each of the $\ast$$\ast$$\ast$first 100 terminals$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ as starting points for the Steiner tree heuristic and keeps the best result. Your program should be executable as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item prog $<$file.\+gph$>$
\end{DoxyItemize}

It should print the objective value (weight) of the best found Steiner tree, for instance


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Obj\+: 664
\end{DoxyItemize}

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\+Please note that this is the last exercise of the lecture and that it will play a major role in the final grading$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$
