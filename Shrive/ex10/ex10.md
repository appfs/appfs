# Exercise 10: Parallel Steiner Tree Heuristic

Extend exercise 9 such that it can be run in parallel (shared memory, e.g. OpenMP for C/C++).
Furthermore, extend your program such that it tries each of the ***first 100 terminals*** as starting points for the Steiner tree heuristic and keeps the best result.
Your program should be executable as follows:

- prog <file.gph>

It should print the objective value (weight) of the best found Steiner tree, for instance

- Obj: 664


***Please note that this is the last exercise of the lecture and that it will play a major role in the final grading***
