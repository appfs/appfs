Write a program that\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item reads in an undirected graph from a file given in .gph format (see \href{http://www.zib.de/koch/SP/data/}{\tt here} for examples) with the filename provided as a command line argument. Note that the graphs have positive edge weights (that are always below 2000000000).
\item computes a longest (with respect to the edge weights) shortest path from any vertex to the vertex with index 1. In case of ties the vertex with smallest index should be chosen.
\item gives an output with the following syntax\+:

R\+E\+S\+U\+L\+T V\+E\+R\+T\+E\+X 42

R\+E\+S\+U\+L\+T D\+I\+S\+T 5553
\end{DoxyItemize}

You may use graph libraries such as boost (for C++) or graph-\/tool (for Python), but you are not allowed to copy the entire program.
