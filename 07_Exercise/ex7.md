# Exercise 7 aka Exercise 5b: Library-based vs. Hand-tailored Shortest Paths

Complement Exercise 5: 

*If you have used libraries (such as boost) for your graph data structure or shortest path algorithm, add your own, hand-tailored version.*
*If you have implemented your own data structures etc., use a library.*
