   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to APPFS-Ex8's documentation!
=====================================

Requirements for the Ex8 python script to run:
1) graph analysis library NetworkX
2) sympy library to calculate primes

PLEASE NOTE:
The code documentation html will be incomplete, as sphinx complained about importing ex8.py because it contained a code line that it found a file directory error with... But this same code snippet was used in ex7.py and sphinx had no problem with it then. I have kept all sphinx files and properties the same for ex8 as for ex7, but this error still remains. More details are in the command terminal. I am open to suggestions to fixing this.
