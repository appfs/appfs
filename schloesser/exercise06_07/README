The "official" solution to ex5 is run via the Makefile. 

Type 'make' or 'make run' to run it.
Type 'make coverage' or 'make coverage2' to run it with coverage (depending on what your coverage-command is).
Type 'make check' or 'make check2' to run to run a codecheck with pylint (depending on what your pylint-command is).
Type 'make doc' generate a documentation with doxygen.
Make sure you have a directory '../data' which contains .gph files, at least 'b15.gph'.


There is also the bonus c solution contained in the directory 'bonus_c'.
You'll also find a makefile there but beware that this is still _under construction_.
