# Exercise 8
Instead of exercise 8, this solution is like exercise 10, but using the un-improved Steiner Heuristics.
* compile using make
* run: `./ex8 <graph filepath> [# of terminals] [-s]`
* `[# of terminals]` is the number of first N terminals to check through to obtain best objective value.
* include `[-s]` flag to print edges of Steiner-subgraph.
