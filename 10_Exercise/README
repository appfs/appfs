Compile:
g++ ex10.cpp -o ex10 -O3 -march=native -std=c++14 -lboost_timer  -lboost_system  -pedantic -Wall ( -fopenmp)

Run:
ex10 <graph.gph> <number_of_starting_nodes>



Please not that this is only a prototype and not proper modern C++. In particular, you should not use raw dynamic arrays but rather C++ vectors. You can switch between a sequence heap from Peter Sanders and and a self-implemented binary heap by (un)defining SEQHEAP in ex10.cpp.
