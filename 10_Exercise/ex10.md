# Exercise 10: Parallel Steiner Tree Heuristic

Extend exercise 9 such that it can be run in parallel (shared memory, e.g. OpenMP for C/C++).
Furthermore, extend your program such that it tries each of the ***first n (user defined parameter) terminals*** as starting points for the Steiner tree heuristic and keeps the best result.
Your program should be executable as follows:

*ex10 file.gph n_start_points (-s)*

It should provide the following output

*TLEN:	best steiner tree objective value*

*TREE:	(from,to)	(from,to)	...* (should only be printed if the parameter *-s* is set)

*TIME:	cputimeall	in	seconds	and	fractions,	like	1.637*

*WALL:	wall-clocktime without	reading	and	printing	and	checking*

Your program should also check that the solution it prints is in fact a Steiner tree (i.e. a tree that contains all terminals). Finally, it should be possible to do a

*make THREADS=XX FILE=YY test*		

which should provide the above output and run with *XX* threads and from 100 start terminals. Graph	files	are	unpacked	at	personal	directory	level			SP/*.gph

***Please note that this is the last exercise of the lecture and that it will play a major role in the final grading***
